# How to Share Your SBS Tracker on GitHub Pages

## Step-by-Step Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create GitHub Account
1. Go to https://github.com/signup
2. Create a free account

### 2. Create New Repository
1. Click the "+" in top right → "New repository"
2. Name it: `sbs-tracker`
3. Description: "SBS Workout Tracker - 3x Program"
4. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. Check "Add a README file"
6. Click "Create repository"

### 3. Upload the Tracker
1. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Drag and drop `index.html` from your computer
3. In the commit message box, type: "Add SBS workout tracker"
4. Click "Commit changes"

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Click "Settings" tab (top of page)
2. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "main" branch
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### 5. Get Your URL
1. Stay on the Pages settings page
2. You'll see: "Your site is live at https://yourusername.github.io/sbs-tracker/"
3. Copy that URL

### 6. Share With Others
Send them the URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/sbs-tracker/index.html`

That's it! Anyone can now access your tracker from any device.

## How It Works For Users

1. They open your link in their browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
2. The tracker loads and works completely offline after first load
3. Their workout data is saved locally on THEIR device
4. Each person's data is private and separate
5. They can add it to their home screen for app-like experience

## To Update the Tracker Later

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on `index.html`
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
4. OR: Delete the old file and upload a new one
5. Commit the changes
6. Wait 1-2 minutes, everyone automatically gets the update

## Data Privacy

**Important:**
- The tracker runs entirely in each user's browser
- Workout data is stored locally (localStorage) on each person's device
- NO data is sent to GitHub or anywhere else
- Each person's progress is completely private
- You cannot see anyone else's workout data (and they can't see yours)

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom URL like `sbs-tracker.com` instead of the GitHub URL:
1. Buy a domain from Namecheap or Google Domains (~$10/year)
2. In GitHub Pages settings, add your custom domain
3. Update DNS settings (GitHub provides instructions)

## Troubleshooting

**"My site isn't live yet"**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

**"Changes aren't showing"**
- Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to rebuild
- Clear browser cache
- Try in private/incognito mode

**"Users can't access it"**
- Make sure repository is Public, not Private
- Double-check the URL you shared
- Make sure it ends with `/index.html`
